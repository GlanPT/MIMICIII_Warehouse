# DataWarehouse MySQL Project using MIMIC-III Dataset

## Overview

This project aims to create a data warehouse using MySQL and the MIMIC-III(https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iii/) dataset. MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) is a large, freely-available database comprising de-identified health-related data associated with over 60,000 intensive care unit (ICU) admissions.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to design and implement a data warehouse that can efficiently store and manage healthcare data from the MIMIC-III dataset. This data warehouse can then be used for various analytical and reporting purposes, such as medical research, quality improvement initiatives, and decision support systems.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Extract relevant data from the MIMIC-III dataset.
- **Data Transformation**: Clean, transform, and prepare the extracted data for loading into the data warehouse.
- **Data Loading**: Load the transformed data into the MySQL-based data warehouse.
- **Data Modeling**: Design and implement a suitable schema for the data warehouse to facilitate efficient querying and analysis.
- **Querying and Analysis**: Perform queries and analyses on the data warehouse to derive insights and support decision-making processes.
